        <h3>Sketching the portrait of her worldview</h3>
        <p>
        Luz Anderfelt's ultimate belief in people's potential to learn from their experiences has produced a kaleidoscopic life journey.   A genuine
        <br>
        interest in science combined with drawing, music, and dance as well as playing team sports were the first activities of her formative years!
        <br>
        Learning a second language, making a family, brief travelling and some work experience prior to university life gave Luz a foundation for reading 
        <br>
        Psychology and Organisations.  She trained as a psychotherapist with an emphasis in philosophy, knowledge whe used in organisational and family 
        <br>
        settings.
        </p>

        <br>
        Luz has a genuine interest in people across cultures.  She likes to think that she is a realist and has a firm believe that people's capacity to do
        <br>
        great things depends on what they believe about themselves, and how they choose to portray it!
