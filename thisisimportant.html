                Art History has always been a foundational source to learn about people's worldview throughout human history.  She

                I find inspiration in the work mentees do.   While learning is important, like facilitation, mentoring is much more 
                <br>
                than a dynamic, interactive version of student support.   Knowing that good mentors are selfless, at the service of
                <br>
                their mentees, the key strength I use is to guide a conversation that helps mentees grow.  I provide frameworks to
                <br>
                add to the mentee's jurney leading to discover appropriate solutions by themselves.

                I do enjoy walking and hiking, and love walking in the rain.  I like to be 'fit'.  I like to seek defining moments
