                <p>
                Python, HTML, CSS, Responsive Websites, flexbox, lists, anchor tags, clickable link, organic design, 
                <br>
                open source, to name a few, were part of my recent experience!  These new language expressions emerged from 
                <br>
                the recent course I took on language programing! Learning to speak French now is not only a passion but also
                <br>
                a need since I am relocating in France.   
                <br>
                <br>
                Art History has always been my passion so I constantly take courses on Art Appreciation.  Photography, history 
                <br> 
                and writing, my language learning journey begins with an exploration of the french regions!  I am currently 
                <br>
                doing pilgrimage in the context of "learning as you Go".  As I feel like a child learning french as a third 
                <br>
                language, working with children has always been my passion as we explore together learning to see whilst doing 
                <br> 
                some life drawing and engage with knowledge about colour.

            <div><h2>In a mentor's role</h2></div>
            
            <p>

                I find inspiration in the work mentees do.  I currently do mentoring for studens in their last year of their degree 
                <br>
                whilst in the process of thinking about what to write their dissertations about.  Learning to have access to a second 
                <br>
                language offers a platform to think and do things differently!

            <div><h2>In a relaxing mood</h2></div>
                <p>
                I do enjoy walking and hiking, and love walking in the rain.  I like to be 'fit'.  I like to seek defining moments
                <br>
                to be in awe?.  I love pursuing the extraordinary for the sake of human kind! something I find in the world 
                <br>
                of the Arts, and in the history of any country's heroes:  Birgitta of Sweden, Alma Deutscher, David Attenborough, 
                <br>
                Jordan Peterson, Bethoven, Alain de Bottom, to name a few!
